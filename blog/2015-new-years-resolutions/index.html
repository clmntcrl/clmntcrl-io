<p>Happy New Year, everyone! The year has just started, and this means it's time to make my New Year's resolutions. I'm not used to this exercise but let's try. What I think my 2015 will look like.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Find a new job</strong>.<br />My wife recently find a new job in Niort (France) and we moved in February. This give me the opportunity to think about my job. I'm currently software engineer in a digital agency since 2009 and had work on STB, Web, smartTVs, tablets and smartphones. If I liked working on those new platforms, I'm really fell in love with the iOS development and all the possibilities it offers. Since the day I have began iOS development I haven't stop to be interested in mobile and tablet applications functioning, design patterns, and all the related things. I know it will be hard to find a job as iOS (native) developer with my current location but that's what I want to do.<br/>So if you are looking for an iOS developer, you can contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/clmntcrl" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Learn lot of things</strong>.<br /><q>The more I learn, the more I have to learn</q>. You certainly know this feeling, for me, this is an exciting part of our job.<br />I'll start the year interested me in Functional Programing, Functional Reactive Programing and Domain Driven Design and we will see where it goes.</li>
	<li><strong>Write and open source</strong>.<br />Last year I start blogging about things I'm working on and I think I can do better. Writing can be a part of my learning process and so write more also mean learn more.</li>
	<li><strong>Improve Echo</strong>.<br />If you read me, you may know that I recently open source <a href="https://github.com/clmntcrl/Echo" target="_blank">Echo</a>, a simple customizable logging framework for Swift. I plan to make it more functional and have some features to implement like thread safety and logging targets.</li>
	<li><strong>Finish my iOS game</strong> without restarting all the devs to try new stuff like design patterns, framework and other things I always want to play with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wait and see...</p>
