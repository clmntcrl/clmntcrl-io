<p>I'm glad to present you Echo, a simple customizable logging framework I built for Swift. It advantageously replace <code>println</code> function by adding some useful details to the console logs such as the level flag, date, time, filename, function name and line number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As developper I think it is good and scary to confront our work with others. Writing on things we are not experimented, make mistakes, challenge yourself, try hard and try again, that's not easy. It's like teaching and learning at the same time. It's difficult but that's how we learn more.</p>
<p>So I decide to write about things I'm working on and open source some part of it, starting with Echo.</p>
